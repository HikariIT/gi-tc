# Genshin Stove

Genshin Stove is a theorycrafting website for damage calculation of virtually any build in the game. Unlike other calculators, which permit one off-field charcter, GS will be able to create rotations with characters swapping in and out of the field at given timeframes, giving data about damage participation and total rotation damage.
