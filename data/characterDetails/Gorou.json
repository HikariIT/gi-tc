Also moves together with your active character.\n· Generates 1 Crystal Collapse every 1.5s that deals AoE Geo DMG to 1 opponent within the skill's AoE.\n· Pulls 1 elemental shard in the skill's AoE to your active character's position every 1.5s (elemental shards are created by Crystallize reactions).\n\nIf a General's War Banner created by Gorou currently exists on the field when this ability is used, it will be destroyed. In addition, for the duration of General's Glory, Gorou's Elemental Skill \"Inuzaka All-Round Defense\" will not create the General's War Banner.\n If Gorou falls, the effects of General's Glory will be cleared.",
