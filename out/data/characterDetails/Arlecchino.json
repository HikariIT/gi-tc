This cannot be overridden.\nWhen in the \"Masque of the Red Death\" state, Arlecchino's Normal Attacks will deal extra DMG to opponents on hit that scales off her ATK multiplied by a certain ratio of her current Bond of Life percentage. This will consume 7.5% of said current Bond of Life. Her Bond of Life can be consumed this way every 0.03s. When her Bond of Life is consumed in this manner, All Is Ash's CD will decrease by 0.8s.",
